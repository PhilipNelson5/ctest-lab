## Formatting the Code

Use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the code. I configured prettier
in [package.json](package.json); you should be able to run it without any
special options:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

If your IDE has an extension to run prettier, that can help automate it for you.
If you use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), I configured
[esbenp.prettier-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
as the default formatter.
